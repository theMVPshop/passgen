        Why Mixed-Character Passwords Matter
    </h1>
    <section class="about-text">
        <p>
      In the digital age, passwords act as the first line of defense against
      cyber threats. Just as you wouldn't use a flimsy lock on your front door,
      you shouldn't skimp on password strength. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Here's why incorporating
      letters, numbers, and symbols in your passwords is so crucial:
    </p>

    <section class="full-accordion">
    <button class="accordion">1. Increased Complexity</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
        At a fundamental level, each additional type of character (uppercase
        letter, lowercase letter, number, symbol) you introduce into your
        password increases its complexity exponentially. This means that a
        password using all these types of characters will be exponentially
        harder for hackers to crack than one using just one type.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">2. Fends Off Brute-Force Attacks</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
        By adding numbers and symbols, you increase the possible combinations
        into the billions or even trillions, making brute-force attacks
        impractical.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">3. Thwarts Dictionary Attacks</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
        Some cybercriminals use dictionary attacks, where every word in the
        dictionary is tried as a potential password. Combining letters with
        numbers and symbols ensures your password isn't a standard word, making
        these attacks ineffective.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">4. Defies Predictability</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
        We humans are creatures of habit, often using predictable phrases or
        sequences. Incorporating a mix of characters ensures that even if a
        hacker can predict part of your password, the mixed characters will
        still present a formidable challenge.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">5. Complies with Best Practices</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
        Many online platforms and security experts recommend (or even mandate)
        using a combination of character types. By following this practice, you
        ensure compatibility and security across various platforms.
      </p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">6. Boosts Overall Security</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
        Every added layer of complexity to your password amplifies the security
        of all your online accounts, from social media to banking. It’s a simple
        step with a massive impact.
      </p>
    </div>

<section class="about-text">
    <p>
         While it might seem tedious to create and remember passwords with letters,
         numbers, and symbols, the enhanced security they offer is well worth the
         effort. Think of it as constructing a digital fortress—one that ensures
         your online presence remains safeguarded against the rising tide of cyber
         threats.
